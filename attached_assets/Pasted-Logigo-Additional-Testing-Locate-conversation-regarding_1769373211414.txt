The "Founder Safety" Checklist (Do this manually)
You don't need to test every edge case, but you must verify the "Data Integrity" loop.
1. The "Voyai Handshake":
    * Action: Log out. Clear cookies. Log in with a new email address (act like a stranger).
    * Pass Condition: You land on the LogiGo chart, and the "Upgrade" button correctly identifies you as "Free" (or "Founder" if you manually assigned it).
2. The "Time Machine" (Database Save):
    * Action: (As a Pro/Founder user) Create a chart. Reload the page.
    * Pass Condition: The chart is still there. (This is the #1 feature they are "paying" for. It cannot fail).
3. The "Credit Limit" (The Proxy):
    * Action: (As a Pro/Founder user with NO custom API key set) Run the Council once.
    * Pass Condition: It works, and the UI meter updates (e.g., "Credits: 1/50").
    * Action: (As a Free user) Run the Council.
    * Pass Condition: It blocks you and asks for a key.
4. The "Git Sync" (Data Exit):
    * Action: (As a Pro user) Click "Sync to GitHub."
    * Pass Condition: A file appears in the repo. (If this corrupts their repo, they will be angry).
5. The "Rescue" Button:
    * Action: Break a node intentionally. Click "Rescue."
    * Pass Condition: The app doesn't crash to a white screen.

Available without signing in:
* Paste code → see flowchart (the main feature)
* Step through execution
* View complexity score
* Use code examples
* Ghost Diff visualization
* Share flowcharts
Requires sign-in (Pro/Founder features):
* Model Arena (AI comparison) - needs API keys or managed allowance
* Save arena sessions to database
* Rabbit Hole Rescue
* GitHub Sync


Code Council

Document AI Model interaction features
- Ask AI to write the code in a node or container
- Ask AI to run the Model Arena / Code Council / Headless council
- Ask AI to show where an error/issue is located in the flowchart / code
- Talk to the agent and get him to do code related tasks
- Ask the agent to rewrite code in a selected node or add a new node with code it writes

Rabbit Hole Rescue demo

Independently test the Model Arena

Think about the integration of the agent and Logigo and how to consistently use AI for coding and communication of details specs including code fixes - Replit and Antigravity are the development partners for new apps and should take as much responsibility as possible and minimize any need for user to actually write code

Test Suite 1: The "Fidget" Test (UI State & Layouts)
Goal: Verify that messing with the view settings doesn't break the rendering. Features Covered: Layout Presets, Zoom Presets, View Levels, Collapsible Containers, Add Labels.
Prompt for Replit Agent: "I need to perform a UI Stress Test on the Workbench. Please open the browser preview and perform the following sequence while I watch:
1. Layouts: Cycle through every Layout Preset (50/50, 30/70, Flow Only). Ensure the panels resize correctly each time.
2. Zoom: Click the 'Fit' zoom button, then manually zoom in to 100%, then out to 25%.
3. Containers: Find a container node in the flowchart (or load the 'Bubble Sort' example). Collapse it, then expand it. Verify the edges redraw correctly.
4. Labels: Double-click a node and add a User Label (// @logigo: Test Label). Verify the blue dot appears.
5. View Levels: If available, toggle the 'Mile High' vs '1000ft' view and verify detail reduction."

Test Suite 2: The "Time Traveler" Test (Execution Engine)
Goal: Verify the interpreter, history, and variable tracking. Features Covered: Algorithmic Examples, Execution Controls, Breakpoints, Variable History, Undo/Redo, Time Travel.
Prompt for Replit Agent: "I need to test the Execution Engine. Please load the 'Bubble Sort' example and do the following:
1. Breakpoints: Right-click the inner loop node to set a red Breakpoint.
2. Execution: Press 'Play'. Verify it pauses at your breakpoint.
3. Variables: Open the 'Variables' tab. Check that the array values are visible.
4. Time Travel: Use the 'Step Back' button (or scrub the timeline) to go back 3 steps. Verify the variables update to their previous state.
5. History: Go to the code editor, delete a line, then press the 'Undo' button in the toolbar. Verify the code returns."

Test Suite 3: The "Council" Test (AI & External Data)
Goal: Verify the AI Arena UI and Sharing. (Note: This costs tokens, so we verify the flow). Features Covered: Model Arena, Example Prompts, Sharable URLs, Ghost Diff.
Prompt for Replit Agent: "I need to test the AI features. Please navigate to the Model Arena page:
1. Templates: Use the dropdown to select the 'Find Duplicates' example prompt.
2. Generation: Click 'Generate'. (Wait for the 4 panels to load).
3. Ghost Diff: Copy one of the AI responses. Go back to the Workbench, paste it over the current code, and toggle 'Ghost Diff'. Verify you see the Green/Red visual changes.
4. Sharing: Click the 'Share' button in the header. Create a link with the title 'Test Share'. Click the resulting link and verify it opens the Read-Only view."

Test Suite 4: The "Deep System" Test (File Sync)
Goal: Verify the "Watch Mode" where backend files update the frontend. Features Covered: LogiGo File Sync, Watch Mode, Natural Language Search.
Prompt for Replit Agent: "I need to test the 'Watch Mode' and file sync.
1. Setup: Open the LogiGo Workbench in the browser.
2. Backdoor Edit: In a separate shell or file editor tab, manually edit data/flowchart.json (or the current source file). Change a node label text to 'HACKED BY AGENT'.
3. Verification: Switch back to the browser. Verify that the flowchart updates automatically within 2-3 seconds without a manual refresh.
4. Search: Use the Natural Language Search bar (Cmd+K) and type 'loops'. Verify it highlights the forloops in the chart."

Summary Checklist for YOU (The Human)
While the Agent runs these, here is what you specifically need to look for:
* [ ] Visual Handshake: (Manual Test) When you click a node, does the Code Editor scroll to the right line?
* [ ] VS Code Extension: (Manual Test) Does the extension load? Does clicking a node in VS Code highlight it in the WebView?
* [ ] Latency: When the Agent does "Time Travel," is the variable update instant, or does it lag?
* [ ] Layout Thrashing: When the Agent switches Layouts, does the graph briefly look "exploded" before settling? (A common bug).
* Would you like me to refine the "File Sync" prompt to include specific shell commands for the Agent to run?
